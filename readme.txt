Website to search for and get data on songs

uses fetch to work with spotify's API, getting authorization and data from searches

styling took a back seat as this project was to learn about HTML requests and working with an API

tried to make it look kinda like spotify with the color scheme, and made it semi scaleable (still wigs out at small screensize)
